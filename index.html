            <h3>A short intro</h3>
            <p>
                I am a mechanical engineer who graduated from the University of Cape Town in 2015 with first class honours. My work experience has seen me successfully take up several varied and challenging roles in the power generation sector from Resident Ownerâ€™s Engineer on the commissioning of a 192 MW gas turbine power plant in Ghana to feasibility analyst for the Power Africa campaign operated by USAID. My experience has not only been diverse in role but also in location having resulted in me being based for substantial periods in Guinea Conakry, Tanzania and Ghana. 
                The time spent executing major projects in the early portion of my career developed my direct technical skills as well offering substantial insights into project and construction management as well project development. The challenging and different environments demanded adaptability as well as fostering an ability to relate to a wide range of people.
